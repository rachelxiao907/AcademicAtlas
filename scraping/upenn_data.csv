University of Pennsylvania,Young Scholars Courses ,Great Transformations,,"This course explores the history and archaeology of the last 20,000 years from the development of agriculture to the industrial revolution. Why did people across the world abandon foraging for farming? How and why did cities and states develop? Why did societies succeed or fail? How have humans transformed themselves and the natural world, including the landscape and the climate? We will explore the methods that archaeologists use to consider these questions and analyze evidence for social and economic change from the Middle East, the Americas, Asia, Africa, Australia and Europe. In addition, students will have a chance to conduct hands-on exercises with artifacts from the Penn Museum during practicums.

University of Pennsylvania,Young Scholars Courses ,World Film History 1945-Present,,"Focusing on movies made after 1945, this course allows students to learn and to sharpen methods, terminologies, and tools needed for the critical analysis of film. Beginning with the cinematic revolution signaled by the Italian Neo-Realism (of Rossellini and De Sica), we will follow the evolution of postwar cinema through the French New Wave (of Godard, Resnais, and Varda), American movies of the 1950s and 1960s (including the New Hollywood cinema of Coppola and Scorsese), and the various other new wave movements of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s (such as the New German Cinema). We will then selectively examine some of the most important films of the last two decades, including those of U.S. independent film movement and movies from Iran, China, and elsewhere in an expanding global cinema culture. There will be precise attention paid to formal and stylistic techniques in editing, mise-en-scene, and sound, as well as to the narrative, non-narrative, and generic organizations of film. At the same time, those formal features will be closely linked to historical and cultural distinctions and changes, ranging from the Paramount Decision of 1948 to the digital convergences that are defining screen culture today. There are no perquisites. Requirements will include readings in film history and film analysis, an analytical essay, a research paper, a final exam, and active participation.

University of Pennsylvania,Young Scholars Courses ,The Twentieth Century: Whose American Dream?,,"Do what you love, and you'll never work a day in your life. This piece of conventional wisdom has long led Americans to believe that if we love to do something, it can't be work. It becomes, essentially, a labor of love--and yet, doesn't even a work of art require work? In this survey course of twentieth-century American literature, we will consider the relationship between the American Dream, the figure of the ""worker,"" and artistic labor writ large. Through our readings of novels, poetry, and films, we will explore contemporary notions about workers in the context of social and economic developments throughout the century, paying particular attention to texts that challenge the association of the figure of ""the worker"" with heteronormative white masculinity and the industrial jobs that make up a shrinking portion of the U.S. economy.

We will focus on themes and questions pertinent to political theory in the modern era, particularly focusing on the relationship of the individual to community, society, and state. Although the emergence of the individual as a central moral, political, and conceptual category arguably began in earlier eras, it is in the seventeenth century that it takes a firm hold in defining the state, political institutions, moral thinking, and social relations. The centrality of ""the individual"" has created difficulties, even paradoxes, for community and social relations, and political theorists have struggled to reconcile those throughout the modern era. We will consider the political forms that emerged out of those struggles, as well as the changed and distinctly ""modern"" conceptualizations of political theory such as freedom, responsibility, justice, rights, and obligations, as central categories for organizing moral and political life.

In others, people struggle for survival amid new and reemerging epidemics and have little or no access to basic or life-saving therapies. Treatments for infectious diseases that disproportionately affect the world's poor remain under-researched and global health disparities are increasing. This interdisciplinary seminar integrates perspectives from the social sciences and the biomedical sciences to explore 1) the development and global flows of medical technologies; 2) how the health of individuals and groups is affected by medical technologies, public policy, and the forces of globalization as each of these impacts local worlds. The seminar is structured to allow us to examine specific case material from around the world (Haiti, South Africa, Brazil, Russia, China, India, for example), and to address the ways in which social, political-economic, and technological factorsâwhich are increasingly global in natureâinfluence basic biological mechanisms and disease outcomes and distribution. As we analyze each case and gain familiarity with ethnographic methods, we will ask how more effective interventions can be formulated. The course draws from historical and ethnographic accounts, medical journals, ethical analyses, and films, and familiarizes students with critical debates on globalization and with local responses to globalizing processes.

We will analyze multiple influential anime series (Astro Boy, Space Battleship Yamato, Akira, Pretty Cure, Chibi Maruko-chan, Naruto, and Pokemon) through theories of postmodern Japanese technology, gender, censorship, nationhood, fandom, translation, nuclearity, and kawaii culture. We will also look at the early days of accessing anime outside of Japan and the rise of cultures around fan-subbing, proto-streaming services, and piracy as well as their effect on contemporary copyright and streaming practices. This course will also pay attention to how anime intersects with global identity politics and representation, which indicates the particular strength of animeÂs cultural export of Japanese-ness to the rest of the world. Finally, we will understand how an analysis of labor divisions in anime production reveals another aspect of animeÂs globality. This course is a discussion-based course, with some lectures,Â  partial streamings of assigned anime, and guest speakers. As we will watch these shows with subtitles, no previous knowledge of Japanese is necessary to enroll in this course.

University of Pennsylvania,Young Scholars Courses ,"Anxiety, Menace, and Peril: The Gothic",,"Picture a night dark and stormy in an edifice colossal and haunted. Horace Walpole's Otranto, Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey, Daphne du Maurier's Manderley. Here are the walls containing the skeletons and the secrets, the pervasive sense of impending danger and inevitable tragedy that exemplify the classic Gothic work. But what if I were to add Taylor Swift's ""Evermore""? Or Jordan Peele's Get Out? Or a good quarter of TikTok? What say you to that? The fact is that the Gothic aesthetic, with its imperiled protagonist and angsty atmosphere, goes backwards and forwards over centuries, overflowing with haunted hallways, dastardly villains, draining hourglassesÂentrancing stand-ins for the horrors that lurk in our own psyches. In this course, we will study classic and contemporary Gothic texts and media, along with supplemental commentary, to determine what exactly ""Gothic"" means. Where the present day fits into the equation. And why, as a fuzzily-boundaried genre, the Gothic has been unflaggingly best-selling, lauded and derided in equal measure, for nearly three hundred years. There will be lots of reading, some critical writing, and multiple opportunities to go outside-the-box in both answering the questions above and deciding what the Gothic will be for the remainder of our century. Assignments include regular mini-exercises, a short critical essay, a presentation on your Gothic passion, and a final project of either critical analysis of your term study or a more creative representation of where that study has taken you. Regular participation in class discussions is crucial. Enter if you dare.

University of Pennsylvania,Young Scholars Courses ,History of Modern China,,"From an empire to a republic, from communism to socialist-style capitalism, few countries have ever witnessed so much change in a hundred year period as China during the twentieth century. How are we to make sense out of this seeming chaos? This course will offer an overview of the upheavals that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed with personal perspectives revealed in primary source readings such as memoirs, novels, and oral accounts. We will start with an analysis of the painful transition from the last empire, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), to a modern nation state, followed by exploration of a century-long tale of incessant reform and revolution. The survey will focus on three main themes: 1) the repositioning of China in the new East Asian and world orders; 2) the emergence of a modern Chinese state and nationalistic identity shaped and reshaped by a series of cultural crises; and finally, 3) the development and transformation of Chinese modernity. Major historical developments include: the Opium War and drug trade in the age of imperialism, reform and revolution, the Nationalist regime, Mao's China, the Cultural Revolution, and the ongoing efforts of post-Mao China to move beyond Communism. We will conclude with a critical review of the concept of ""Greater China"" that takes into account Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Chinese diaspora in order to attain a more comprehensive understanding of modern China, however defined, at the end of the last century.
